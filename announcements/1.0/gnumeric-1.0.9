Gnumeric 1.0.9 'A little bit oh luvin' is now available.

    This is a low priority bug fix release, new development is being
    done in version 1.1.x based on gnome2.

    There are a collection of small fixes for the excel, lotus, and
    applix importers.  The net result is that we can now load our
    entire test suite of 500 odd workbooks with no unexpected
    errors.  This will be the last release on the 1.0.x branch for a
    while.
