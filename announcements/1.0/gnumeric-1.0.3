Gnumeric 1.0.3 is now available.

	This release syncs up with Guppi 0.40.3.  The graphing
	interface has been improved a bit.  Several other extensions
	have come in under the wire before the Gnome2 port takes
	over the development tree.  Many thanks the Andreas, Neil,
	and the testers for their valiant attempt to make the COUP
	functions MS Excel (tm) compatible.  When it was revealed
	that Excel was not compatible with itself, they were able to
	simplify the code, and limit the calculations to being
	correct.

	I've back-ported a nice performance patch for
	    http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=68723
	It is NOT enabled by default but the code can be enabled by toggling
	an #define in src/eval.c.  The patch appears to work smoothly, but I'm
	not going to monkey with the dependency engine in the stable branch,
	even for 2 orders of magnitude.
