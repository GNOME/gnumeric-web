Gnumeric 1.1.8 aka 'Its Pango-rrrrrrific!' is now available.

    Ah the joys of open source.  Just as a I was hunkering down preparing to
    finish the conversion to pango _WHAM_ a patch lands in bugzilla.  Gnumeric
    is now fully pangoized, GdkFont usage is no more.  There may be some
    performance tuning later, but the first pass through the display engine is
    done.  Please send us some samples of xls that contain non latin-1
    characters.  I'd also like to hear performance comparisons with per pango
    versions.  Things look ok on fast machines, but I have not tested things on
    the trusty P100.

    Although the xls files produced by the conversion to libgsf were readable by
    MS Excel Gnumeric-1.0.x and libole2 were not thrilled with them.  So libgsf
    and the excel exporter have had more polish and things are fully functional
    again.  No data will be lost, Gnumeric-1.1.x and MS Excel can read the files.

    Jukka Pekka has been extending the solver even further and Jon Kåre and
    Morten have been examining libgsf to ensure its ready for large files (just
    in case zip ever support more than 5 gig of data).

    Also a special thanks to Ariya Hidayat from kword (and to Abiword for
    noticing).   His work on mapping WordPerfect characters -> unicode improved
    the plan perfect importer nicely.

    NOTE : We have disabled building 1.1 using gcc-2.96.  There are a few known
       areas where the compiler shipped with RH/Mandrake was causing numeric
       inaccuracies in Gnumeric.  If you don't mind that feel free to manually
       remove the prohibition.

    NOTE : Although this is a development release it should be quite stable.
      There are is still feature regressions from 1.0 (porting graphs to gtk2)
      but other than that this release should be usable.  Please play with it.

dorami@bu.iij4u.or.jp:
	* Begin to use Pango in cells.

Jody:
	* Add XL import for polygon colours.
	* More pango work.
	* Fix icon assignment.
	* Support pasting utf8
	* Rewrite plan perfect import, significantly more useful now.
	  Includes some format transfer and uses the word-perfect
	  charset map from kword (thanks to Ariya Hidayat)
	* Cull out a pile of special iconv code in favor of glib
	* Fix documentation installation to match libgnome's expectations
	* locale -> utf8 conversion for lotus wk1 importer
	* support for BITAND and BITOR in lotus wk1 importer
	* Tweak XL export so that MS Excel does not produce a warning when
	  reading our sheets.
	* Partially fix printing images

Jon Kåre:
	* Port to new libgsf big file api

Jukka:
	* Solver improvements:
	  - Imported the GLPK (GNU linear programming kit) version 3.2.
	    It provides a revised simplex algorithm for solving large
	    scale problems, written by Andrew Makhorin.  It performs 
	    much better than lp-solve if the model is large, see
	    a benchmark in ftp://plato.la.asu.edu/pub/lpsimp.txt.
	  - Added the algorithm selection into the dialog.
	  - Other dialog improvements.
	* Speed optimizations for the MPS plugin.

Morten:
	* Add poor man's utf8 regexp routines.

Christian Meyer:
	* Renamed "Print Setup" to "Page Setup" in the file menu and the
	  gnumeric documents.

Zbigniew:
	* Work on the plugins.
	* Plugins can now register menu and toolbar items (bonobo only for now)
	* Another step towards a gtk only build.

* Availability
