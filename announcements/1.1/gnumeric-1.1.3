Gnumeric 1.1.3 aka 'slicker than a greased monkey' is now available.

	All the recent algorithmic cleanup for dependencies brought a new hot
	spot into view, malloc/free.  Exiting large sheets (~500,000 cells) was
	taking 20-30 seconds just to free all the twiddly little bits.  With
	typical efficiency Morten stepping in with a couple of custom
	allocators and we're now down under 3 seconds.  In the mean time
	Andreas has been bounding along polishing off the ui conversion.  All
	dialogs are now gtk2 happy.  Jon Kåre has done an initial re-enabling
	of bonobo support, even adding use as a BonoboControl.   Jukka-Pekka
	has continued to work on the solver.  I tossed in a few small
	improvements, like completing the support for encrypted xls files.

	We're still missing graphs in gnome2, but Jon is hard at work on a port
	so hopefully we'll be fully functional soon.
