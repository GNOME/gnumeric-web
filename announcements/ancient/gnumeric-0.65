Gnumeric 0.65 is brought to you by the number '42' and dedicated to the memory
of Mr. Douglas Adams,  his humour made even airports funny.

This is a stable release.  The new code focuses on improving usability and
smoothing corner cases.  It marks the first time that exporting in MS Excel95
format is considered stable enough to optionally overwrite existing xls files.
It also greatly improves style defragmentation.  If your workbooks had
started using hundreds of megabytes and slowed to a crawl load them with 0.65
and resave.

Note to packagers : Several dependencies have upped their version requirements.
    gnome-xml (libxml1) 1.8.12 	- fixes some obscure infinite loops on bad input)
    GAL			0.8	- improves the colour combo box
    libole2		0.2.2	- Memory leakage when writing ole files
