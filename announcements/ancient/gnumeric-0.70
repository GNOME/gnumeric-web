Gnumeric 0.70 aka 'Mama said there'd be days like this' is now available.

This is a high priority upgrade.   0.69 accidentally broke importing MS Excel
workbooks containing more than one sheet.  It would somewhat silently
superimpose all of the content in the first sheet.  There are several other
small fixes and improvements as we near feature freeze.  Beware of graphs they
are even less stable now that in previous releases.  The current code is a
partial development snapshot.  If you can build it you can play with it, but
don't expect the same code to be there tomorrow.
