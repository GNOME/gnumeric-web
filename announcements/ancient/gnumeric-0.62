Gnumeric 0.62 aka 'stork attack' is now available.  I currently consider
this a development release.  It has a number of important fixes for 0.61 but
it also includes a fair amount of new code.  If after one week things seem as
stable as our testing suggested I'll upgrade the status.

This version of Gnumeric includes the first of 3 steps designed to improve
performance and scalability.  We can now comfortably load 1M cells onto a slow
machine with 128Meg.  It also includes some initial steps toward improving
plugins.

PACKAGERS BE CAREFUL!  The structure of the plugin directories has changed.

NOTE : Please do not package or submit bug reports for gnumeric-bonobo.  Bonobo
       has been frozen for GNOME 1.4 but has not yet become part of the
       official platform.  It is fairly stable but not yet the default build.
