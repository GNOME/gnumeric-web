Gnumeric 0.72 aka 'oooh yummy eye candy' is now available.

    This is primarily bug fixes as we prepare for a production ready release
    before the end of the year.  Graphs require Guppi 0.40.0. In addition to
    the plethora of small improvements we threw in a few extras to make it fun.
    Morten's improved search console is very nice, and thanks to Andreas range
    selection and non-modal dialogs are now outnumber the old ones.  We now
    support auto-scrolling during object creation which makes all mouse actions
    auto-scrollable.

    Chema and his army of evil monkeys have been kicking the tires trying to
    make things fail.  Please give him a hand.  We always prefer to find the
    bugs BEFORE we release :-)
