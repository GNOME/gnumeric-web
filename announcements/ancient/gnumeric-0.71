Gnumeric 0.71 aka 'Slicker than a greased pig in a Jello fight' is now available.

	This is a Major release for many reasons
	- Graphs are now a supported feature in the production build
	- It is significantly faster and smaller
	- We are now in feature freeze and preparing for
	  an official stable release.  (There are a few pending patches)

    Graph support requires CVS guppi3.  A release will be made shortly to sync
    with gnumeric.  Many thanks to Jon Trowbridge for his tireless work on
    Guppi, and to the many new contributors to this release.
