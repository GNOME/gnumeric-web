	<h2><span class="gnumeric-bullet"></span>Calculation</h2>
	<p>This technical note describes how Gnumeric does
	  calculations internally and why certain simple calculations
	  like 0.3-(3*0.1) give unexpected non-zero results.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="generalitem">
	<h2><span class="gnumeric-bullet"></span>Number System</h2>
	<p>Numbers in Gnumeric are so-called floating-point numbers
	  described in the
	  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_floating_point">IEEE-754
	  standard</a>.  Specifically we are using the
	  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_precision">double
	  precision</a> format described therein.  (It is possible to
	  set up Gnumeric to use another format, but it is very rarely
	  done.  Unless you have worked hard on doing that, you may
	  assume that you are indeed using "double precision".)</p>
	<p>This choice of number system has consequences just like
	making another choice of number system would have come with a
	different set of consequences.  Here are some of the
	consequences of using "double precision":</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Gnumeric can only work with numbers whose magnitude are
	  less than about 10<sup>300</sup>.  This does not normally
	  cause any problems.</li>
	  <li>Numbers that are too close to zero will be rounded to
	  zero.  The limit is about 10<sup>-300</sup>.  Such a
	  rounding to zero is called underflow.</li>
	  <li><strong>Not all numbers can be precisely
	  represented.</strong>  When a number that cannot be
	  represented is used, it will be internally rounded to the
	  nearest number that can be represented.  The distance
	  between representable numbers is much smaller for numbers
	  close to zero than it is for large numbers.</li>
	  <li>All integers up to about 10<sup>16</sup> can be
	  precisely represented.  That is the good news.</li>
	  <li><strong>The numbers 0.1, 0.01, ... cannot be precisely
	  represented.</strong>  This is for the same reason that a
	  desk calculator cannot precisely represent 1/3 but uses
	  something like 0.33333333 instead.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>"Double precision" has some special values like "Infinity"
	and "Not-a-number".  When encountered, these are turned into
	error values in Gnumeric.  We also do our best to hide the
	value "-0" from users.</p>
	<p>Note: "double precision" is what pretty much every program
	uses because it is what the hardware works
	with.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel">Microsoft
	Excel</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LibreOffice_Calc">LibreOffice</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenOffice_Calc">OpenOffice</a>,
	and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_%28programming_language%29">R</a>
	all are based on "double precision".</p>
      </div>
      <div class="generalitem">
	<h2><span class="gnumeric-bullet"></span>Operations of Numbers</h2>
	<p>When an operation like addition is performed in Gnumeric,
	that operation will get a number of argument values and
	produce one or more output values.  It is important to realize
	that the argument values that the operation gets are always
	representable numbers, i.e., <em>any rounding needed to make
	numbers representable has already taken place.</em>  The job of
	the operation is to calculate its result using the arguments
	and round the result to the nearest representable number.</p>

	<p>For example, for the division 1/10 where the arguments ("1"
	and "10") are both precisely representable, we calculate the
	mathematical value one-tenth and round that into the nearest
	representable value which happens to be exactly
	0.1000000000000000000013552527156068805425093160010874271392822265625.
	That value clearly is a tiny bit bigger than one tenth in the
	same way the desk calculator's 0.33333333 is a tiny bit
	smaller than one third.</p>

	<p>Rounding errors tend to add up.  Computing 0.3-(3*0.1), for
	example, one does not get zero as one might have hoped for.
	Each individual sub-result is subject to rounding to
	representable values, so we are really computing
	r(r(0.3)-r(r(3)*r(0.1))) where "r" is the rounding operation.
	The end result is about -6*10<sup>-17</sup>.  That is an
	unpleasant result of working with finite-precision math.</p>

	<p>For more complex operations, like ERF(0.25), the goal is
	still to produce the exact result rounded to nearest
	representable value.  Again, the term "exact result" is based
	on the argument value as already rounded to a representable
	number.  We do not always achieve this goal, i.e., we
	sometimes calculate a value that is slightly off from the
	nearest representable value.  If we have at least about 15
	correct significant digits we are not too concerned by this,
	but anything less is worth reporting as a bug.  Note, however,
	that Gnumeric in general produces results that are far more
	accurate than other spreadsheets.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="generalitem">
	<h2><span class="gnumeric-bullet"></span>Difference to Microsoft Excel</h2>
	<p>Microsoft Excel uses the same number system as Gnumeric,
	but Microsoft Excel does some operations differently.</p>

	<p>If the top-level operand of an expression is a subtraction
	and the result of the subtraction is very close to zero
	compared to the two arguments, then the result will be rounded
	to zero.  This operation, called <em>snap-to-zero</em>, is
	also performed for addition and the subtraction implied by
	comparisons.  Is is not performed for operations deeper in an
	expression, not even for subtractions surrounded by nothing
	but parentheses.</p>

	<p>Snap-to-zero has the effect of hiding the small rounding
	errors that arise by the representation error on 0.01.  That
	is, accounting calculations on amounts of dollars and cents
	will appear to be accurate most of the time.</p>

	<p>But snap-to-zero comes at a price:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Snap-to-zero will take place even if the difference
	    between two numbers is not the cause of representation
	    errors.  Excel will claim that two numbers are equal even
	    when they are not.</li>
	  <li>It becomes possible to have three numbers A1, A2, and
	    A3, where A1=A2 and A2=A3, but A1&lt;&gt;A3.</li>
	  <li>It is possible for A1-5005=0 and at the same time
	    A1-5004-1&lt;&gt;0.</li>
	  <li>It is possible to have A1=A2, but (say)
	    TAN(A1)&lt;&gt;TAN(A2).</li>
	  <li>Snap-to-zero can greatly increase rounding errors in
	    scientific calculations.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Gnumeric does not do snap-to-zero.  We recommend an
	explicit rounding operation where it matters.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="generalitem">
	<h2><span class="gnumeric-bullet"></span>Difference to LibreOffice/OpenOffice</h2>
	<p>LibreOffice and OpenOffice both use the same number system
	as Gnumeric.  These programs both use snap-to-zero (see
	above), but use it much more aggressively than Microsoft
	Excel.  In particular, every subtraction is subject to
	snap-to-zero and there are no easy ways of performing a
	subtraction that does not snap-to-zero.  Snap-to-zero is also
	done internally in many sheet functions, for example in VAR.
	There does not seem to be any accurate and complete
	documentation for snap-to-zero.</p>

	<p>The lack of an honest subtraction operation makes it hard
	to even test the accuracy of sheet-level functions.
	LibreOffice and OpenOffice will claim that a result matches a
	  reference value even when they do not.  (Update: LibreOffice
	nowadays has a function that allows raw subtraction.)</p>
      </div>
      <div class="generalitem">
	<h2><span class="gnumeric-bullet"></span>Alternate Number Systems</h2>
	<p>We sometimes get asked why Gnumeric is not using some other
	number system that would avoid a particular problem a user is
	seeing.</p>
	<ul>
	  <li><strong>Arbitrary precision:</strong> computers are
	    powerful today and should be able to just using enough
	    precision that all these rounding issues would go away,
	    right?  Well, no.  If one tried that, an immediate
	    consequence would be that sometimes basic operators like "+"
	    and comparisons like "&lt;" would take an unbounded amount
	    of time, i.e., the program would "hang" instead of producing
	    an answer.  This is a consequence
	    of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem">the
	      undecidable halting problem</a> and there is no escaping
	    it.</li>
	  <li><strong>A base-10 format:</strong> if we used a base-10
	    ("decimal") format then 0.1 and 0.01 would be precisely
	    representable, even if some other set of numbers would not
	    be.  We could, in fact, do that.  We do not do so because
	    we have no support from the compiler and lower-level
	    libraries that we use.  Until they support such a number
	    system, we cannot.  To do this right would be a fantastic
	    amount of work and we do not expect it to happen.</li>
	  <li><strong>As entered:</strong> some people believe we
	    should keep values precisely as entered, i.e., basically as
	    strings.  This is severely misguided.  It would have the
	    same problems as for arbitrary precision above, and on top
	    of that it would have extra problems.  For example, if a
	    value of "999,123" is entered into a spreadsheet somewhere
	    in Europe and that file is subsequently sent to The United
	    States, then the initial value of a little less than one
	    thousand might be interpreted as a value of a little less
	    than one million.  Clearly that is madness.  (There are
	    further problems that are outside the scope of this
	    note.)</li>
